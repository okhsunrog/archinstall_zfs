## Archinstall‑ZFS ✨

ZFS‑first Arch Linux installer with batteries included. Effortless ZFS root, automatic ZFSBootMenu, and a fast, friendly TUI.

[![Demo](assets/archinstall-demo.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/IgofIGOQP9AXUCVbDHIAstlPz)

### Highlights

- 🚀 Fast path to an Arch+ZFS system
- 🧰 Three install modes: full‑disk, new pool on a partition, or use an existing pool
- 🧯 Automatic ZFSBootMenu with recovery options
- 🧪 Boot‑environment aware mounts via a custom ZED hook (mounts only datasets from the active BE + shared ones)
- 🔐 Native ZFS encryption (pool‑wide or per‑dataset)
- 🧩 Seamless integration with archinstall profiles
- 🖥️ Smooth TUI experience with clear logging

Requirements: UEFI firmware and internet connectivity (both are validated by the installer).

## Quickstart ⚡

### Option A — Prebuilt ISO (recommended)

1) Download the latest ISO from [Releases](https://github.com/okhsunrog/archinstall_zfs/releases).
2) Boot it on your machine (UEFI).
3) Connect to the network.
4) Run the installer:

```bash
./installer
# or
cd /root/archinstall_zfs && python -m archinstall_zfs
```

Notes:
- The ISO already contains ZFS modules and this installer.
- Source code is available at `/root/archinstall_zfs` inside the live system.

### Option B — Official Arch ISO

1) Boot the official Arch ISO and connect to the network.
2) Install minimal deps:

```bash
pacman -Sy git
```

3) Fetch and run the installer:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/okhsunrog/archinstall_zfs
cd archinstall_zfs
python -m archinstall_zfs
```

This path takes a bit longer because it installs ZFS modules on the fly. The prebuilt ISO already includes them.

## Features ✨

- 📦 Full‑disk auto‑partitioning, new‑pool on partition, or use existing pool
- 🧭 ZFSBootMenu setup with sensible defaults
- 🧩 Profile support via archinstall
- 🧱 ZED hook to keep zfs‑list.cache scoped to the active boot environment
- 🔐 ZFS encryption: Pool or per‑dataset
- 🧾 Robust logs and error handling

## Swap options

- **No swap**: Skip configuring swap.
- **ZRAM only**: Compressed, RAM-backed swap using zram-generator. We disable zswap in this mode.
- **ZSWAP + swap partition**:
  - Full-disk installs: creates a tail swap partition at the end of the disk.
  - New/existing pool modes: select an existing partition by-id to use as swap.
  - Two variants: unencrypted (plain mkswap) or encrypted with a random key each boot (dm-crypt via crypttab; mapped as `/dev/mapper/cryptswap`).

Notes:
- Swap on ZFS zvol and swapfiles on ZFS are not supported.
- Hibernation/resume is not supported in the current release.

## Development 🧑‍💻

The `gen_iso` directory ships everything to build custom ISOs and test them in QEMU. Use `just` to orchestrate common workflows.

### Host prerequisites (Arch Linux)

```bash
sudo pacman -S qemu-desktop edk2-ovmf archiso grub just rsync
```

Why grub? mkarchiso may fail to produce a bootable image without it installed on the host.

Optional: Install uv for a fast Python workflow.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
just setup   # installs dev deps via uv
```

### Build ISOs

Unified templated profile at `gen_iso/profile` is rendered to `/tmp/archzfs-profile` and then built.

```bash
# Full (main) ISO
just build-main pre            # Precompiled ZFS, kernel=linux-lts (default)
just build-main dkms           # DKMS + linux-lts-headers (default kernel)
just build-main dkms linux     # DKMS + linux-headers, kernel=linux

# Minimal (testing) ISO, faster to build
just build-test pre             # Precompiled ZFS, kernel=linux-lts, minimal packages
just build-test dkms            # DKMS + linux-lts-headers, minimal packages
just build-test dkms linux      # DKMS + linux-headers, minimal packages, kernel=linux

just list-isos                  # List built ISOs in gen_iso/out
```

Notes:
- Testing builds use a minimal package set for faster iterations.
- Main builds include the full set. When `kernel=linux`, `broadcom-wl` and `b43-fwcutter` are included; they are omitted for `linux-lts`/others.
- Artifacts land in `gen_iso/out`.

### Templating model (Jinja2)

We use Jinja2 templates in `gen_iso/profile` to produce a concrete ArchISO profile before building.

- Templates:
  - `packages.x86_64.j2` (package list)
  - `pacman.conf.j2`
  - `profiledef.sh.j2`
  - `efiboot/loader/entries/01-archiso-x86_64-linux.conf.j2`
- Builder context keys:
  - `kernel`: `linux`, `linux-lts`, or `linux-zen`
  - `use_precompiled_zfs` / `use_dkms` (mutually exclusive)
  - `include_headers`: whether to add `{{kernel}}-headers` (auto=true for DKMS)
  - `fast_build`: minimal testing build when true; full main build when false
- Package split logic:
  - Testing-only: inside `{% if fast_build %}`
  - Main-only: inside `{% else %}`
  - Common to both: present in both branches
  - Kernel-specific: guarded (e.g., `{% if kernel == "linux" %}` for `broadcom-wl`, `b43-fwcutter`)

### Test in QEMU

Quick path for development:

```bash
just qemu-setup           # Create disk + UEFI vars
just build-testing-iso
just qemu-install-serial  # Headless serial console (recommended for dev)

# In a second terminal
just ssh                  # Sync source into VM and connect via SSH
./installer               # Run the installer in the SSH session
```

Helpful commands:

```bash
just qemu-install         # GUI install flow
just qemu-run             # Boot existing install (GUI)
just qemu-run-serial      # Boot existing install (serial)
just qemu-refresh         # Reset disk + UEFI vars
```

The testing ISO is tuned for faster build times by using a minimal package list. It is rendered from the same profile with a fast mode flag.

### Inside the ISO

```bash
./installer           # Shortcut wrapper (cds into /root/archinstall_zfs)
cd /root/archinstall_zfs && python -m archinstall_zfs
```

The source is available at `/root/archinstall_zfs` in both ISO profiles.

### All `just` recipes (high level)

## Why this installer? 💡

- Simplifies ZFS on Arch end‑to‑end
- ZFSBootMenu and encryption handled for you
- Boot‑env aware mounts to prevent cross‑environment surprises
- Smooth dev loop with a testing ISO and `just ssh` syncing

## Roadmap / TODO 🗺️

1. System Enhancements
   - Smarter hostid generation (based on hostname)
   - Local ZFSBootMenu build support
   - Secure Boot support (sign kernels/ZBM and manage keys)

2. Additional Features
   - More ZFS tuning options (compression, DirectIO, etc.)
   - zrepl support: guided setup for backup/replication
   - Archinstall language selection in the menu
